## 👋 Hi, I’m Guilherme (@GuiRosario)

💻 I'm currently working as a **Systems Analyst** at the **Secretary of Education of Tocantins**.  
⚙️ I develop web applications using **JavaScript (React)** on the front-end and **Python (Django)** on the back-end.  
🌱 I’m currently learning **PHP with Laravel** to expand my full-stack skills.  
🎮 My main interests are **cars, games, and music** — and I’m always curious to explore new technologies and learn more every day.  

📫 You can reach me at: **gdasilvarosario@gmail.com**

✨ Always learning. Always building. 🚀
